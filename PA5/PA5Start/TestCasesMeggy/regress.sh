#!/bin/sh
# regress.sh is a shell script that compares a MeggyJava compiler (MJ.jar)
# generated .s files run through the Meggy Simulator (MJSIM.jar) agains
# a Java-only version of the Meggy run-time library.  Both the Java only 
# version and the Meggy Simulator print out text messages about what is
# happening in the program so that diffs can be performed.
# This script assumes that MJSIM.jar is in the same directory
# as regress.sh is being run.  Additionally, there needs to be a meggy/
# subdirectory with the Java-only meggy package.
# The script assumes that the compiler being checked is one directory up
# in ../MJ.jar.
#
# This script will by default do the comparison for all .java files in the 
# WorkingTestCases/ and WorkingErrorTestCases/ subdirectories.
# However, if one specific file is given as input, then the test will only
# be done on that file.

# usage examples: 
#   ./regress.sh
#   ./regress.sh file.java

# Note that test cases in .java files can have corresponding .arg_opt
# files.  Such files indicate button presses and other user interaction
# with the device.  Both the meggy simulator and the Java-only Meggy
# library use these files when they exist.

# After you run this script, there will be a lot of .class, .dot, and .s
# files in the script
